# Mapty-App

Map your workouts with the new version of the Mapty App project, built in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript Course on Udemy. 
This is the course version with some bonus features implemented by myself, such as: delete/edit workouts, geocode workout location, delete/show all workouts and 
sort workouts by distance. 
The application is a JavaScript practice project with an OOP architecture, using new features such as ES6 Classes, private fields, async/await and much more.
